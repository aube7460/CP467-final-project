	-scale.png

Zoning: (Jesper)
	-Divide the image up into quadrants, calculate percentage in each quadrant, output as vector
	-zone.png

Character Recognition: (Jason)
	-Finding smallest Euclidean distance to determine what character the image is (compared to all vectors stored in the DB)

Run through the whole OCR: (Will)
	-Display output
	-Ask audience to choose a number to use the OCR on (draw on laptop, then insert)
	-Then use a Letter
	-Explain validation process, how we use it
	-Draw CP467 on 200px by 200px blank .png image

Future Outlook: (All)
	-Talk about using grammar rules in the future
	-Everyone talks about one idea they would like to improve on
